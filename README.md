### Learning Clean (programming language)

I know very little about the Clean programming language. This document will go over all of my knowledge of the Clean programming language.

#### Hello World in Clean

This is how you make a Hello World program in Clean:

```clean
Start = "Hello, world!"
```

#### Comments in Clean

Comments in Clean are the same as in languages like C, C++, Java, etc.

##### Single line comments

Single line comments in Clean are written like so:

```clean
// This is a single line comment
```

##### Multi-line comments

I don't know if Clean supports multi-line comments.

#### Break keyword in Clean

Clean does not appear to support the `break` keyword.

<!-- To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_ !-->

#### Other knowledge of the Clean programming language

1. Clean is a language by the Software Technology Research Group of Radboud University Nijmegen in The Netherlands

2. Clean is not a semicolon and curly bracket language

3. Clean has syntax very similar to that of Haskell

4. Clean uses the `*.icl` file extension by default, but also uses the `*.dcl` and `*.abc` file extensions

5. The `*.abc` file extension can be confused with an ABC (another programming language) program.

7. Clean is not one of the top 50 programming languages (as of 2022, July 31st, it has never ranked 50 or higher on the TIOBE index)

8. Clean was first created in the year 1987

9. No other knowledge of the Clean programming language

#### Additional comments

1. No other additional comments available
